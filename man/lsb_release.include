[DESCRIPTION]

lsb_release prints certain LSB (Linux Standard Base) and Distribution
infomation.
[FILES]

If the installation is LSB compliant, the \fB"/etc/lsb-release"\fR
file should contain the \fBLSB_VERSION\fR field. 
The value of the field should be a colon separated list of
supported module versions indicating the LSB specification 
modules to which the installation is compliant. If the installation is not
compliant, the above field should 
.B not
be present.

Optional fields are \fBDISTRIB_ID\fR, \fBDISTRIB_RELEASE\fR,
\fBDISTRIB_CODENAME\fR, \fBDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION\fR.

If the \fB"/etc/lsb-release.d"\fR directory exists, it is
searched for filenames which are taken as additional module-version
strings to add to \fBLSB_VERSION\fR.
 
The required line style is:
.br 
"\fIDistributor\fR \fBrelease\fR \fIx.x\fR \fB(\fR\fICodename\fR\fB)\fR"

Where \fIDistributor\fR can be a couple of words, but then concatenated
(i.e. Linux Foo BarLinux Linux -> FooBarLinux),
.br
\fIx.x\fR starts with a digit followed by any non-blank characters,
\fICodename\fR will also be concatenated (blanks cleanup only).

[EXAMPLES]
If the "\fB/etc/lsb-release\fR" file contains:

LSB_VERSION="core-2.0-ia64:core-2.0-noarch"
.br
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="I enjoy using my distrib"

and the "\fB/etc/lsb-release.d\fR" directory contains:

graphics-2.0-ia64    graphics-2.0-noarch

Then the results of various options will be:

.B $ ./lsb_release --all
.br
LSB Version:    core-2.0-ia64:core-2.0-noarch:graphics-2.0-ia64:graphics-2.0-noarch
.br
Distributor ID: MyDistrib
.br
Description:    I enjoy using my distrib
.br
Release:        1.0RC4
.br
Codename:       TryIt

.B $ ./lsb_release -a -s
.br
1.0 MyDistrib "I enjoy using my distrib" 1.0RC4 TryIt
