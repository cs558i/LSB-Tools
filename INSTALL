To build the package (actually, only byte-compiling the Python code), run:
$ make

To install as a system utility, as the root user, run:
# make install

To create a packaged directory, run as your packaging user:
$ DESTDIR=/path/to/package make install

Note that DESTDIR is intended to create a package for the current system,
instead of directly installing into a different OS tree.  So the install
process probes the init system with /sbin/init, not $(DESTDIR)/sbin/init.
If you are installing into a different OS tree or creating a package for
a different OS tree, or your init system is not installed yet, you need
to specify INIT=sysv or INIT=systemd to indicate the type of the init
system of the target OS tree.  For example:
$ DESTDIR=/mnt/lfs-systemd INIT=systemd make install

Or (if systemd will be installed, but it is not installed yet in the OS
tree currently chroot'ed into):
(chroot)# INIT=systemd make install
